This directory contains the source for a program written to be compiled with
DEC Fortran and run on a Vax or Alpha (vaxNumbers.for) and one written to be
compiled with gfortran and run on an intel-based Macintosh.  The output files
show the difference in bytes for 4 byte integers and reals written on the two
systems.
