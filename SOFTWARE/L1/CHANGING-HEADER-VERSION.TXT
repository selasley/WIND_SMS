                        CHANGING THE L1 HEADER VERSION
Edit the file L1READ.INC, located in the directory pointed to by the logical
name INC_DIR:.
Find the DATA statement which contains the variable max_version.  Note that
max_version is a CHARACTER*2 variable and is initialized to the ASCII
representation of a number, as opposed to being an INTEGER and being
initialized to the number itself.
Change the value to which max_version is initialized to the new highest header
version.  Usually this is the next value in the ASCII collating sequence, with
the restriction that the two characters must be in the range ['0'..'9'].
Edit the file WIND_L1_READ_SR.FOR located in the directory [WIND.SOFTWARE.L1].
