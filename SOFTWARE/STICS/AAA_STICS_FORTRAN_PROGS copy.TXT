The following are WIND-STICS FORTRAN programs used for analyzing STICS data:
    DIRECTORY => SMS1:[WIND.SOFTWARE.STICS]
	1.1  STX_MMQ_TABLE.FOR		Prints out a table of the PHA data in column format
					with the mass and mass/charge already determined
	1.2  STX_MQET_MATRIX.FOR	Writes the mass and mass/charge in matrix format.
	1.3  STICS_MQET_MATRIX.FOR	Writes the mass and mass/charge in matrix format.
	   				Older version of 1.2.				
	1.4  WSTICS_RATES.FOR		Provides time trend of omni-directional rates and
 					solar wind speed (SMS-MASS).
	1.5  STICS_PHA_SPECTRA.FOR	Calculates the flux for each ion at each voltage step.
	1.6  VSHIFT_SPECTRA.FOR		Calculates the flux binned according to V/Vsw using
					MASS solar wind speeds.
	1.7  VSHIFT_SPECTRA_SWE.FOR	Calculates the flux binned according to V/Vsw using
					SWE solar wind speeds.
	1.8  VSHIFT_SPECTRA_MASS3D.FOR	Calculates the 3-D distribution funcition binned according 
					to V/Vsw using MASS solar wind speeds.
	1.9  VSHIFT_SPECTRA_SWE3D.FOR	Calculates the 3-D distribution funcition binned according 
					to V/Vsw using SWE solar wind speeds.
	1.10 STICS_PHA_TREND.FOR	Creates time trend data file for selected ion. Data given
					for two energy ranges with full azimuthal information for
					each telescope. 
	
	1.11 STICS_DVS_SECT.FOR		Creates file containing flux binned according to sector 
					and voltage step for each telescope. 
	1.12 STICS_DVS_TIME.FOR		Generates file with flux for each voltage step against time
					using PHA data.
IDL programs used to create plots from data files generated by some of the above FORTRAN programs:
    DIRECTORY =>  SMS1:[CHOTOO.IDL_PROGRAMS]
	2.1  STICS_SCATTER1.PRO		Creates scatter plot of Mass vs Mass/Charge. Requires two
					data files: one from STX_MMQ_TABLE.FOR (1.1) and the other
					from STX_MQET_MATRIX.FOR (1.2).
	2.2  STICS_CONTOUR.PRO		Creates contour plot of Mass vs Mass/Charge from data file
					generated by STICS_MQET_MATRIX.FOR (1.3).
	2.3  DAILYRATEPLT.PRO		Plots STICS rates and MASS solar wind speed against time 
					from data file generated by WSTICS_RATES.FOR (1.4) for 
					DAY-long files.
	2.4  RATETIMEPLT.PRO		Plots STICS rates and MASS solar wind speed against time 
					from data file generated by WSTICS_RATES.FOR (1.4) for 
					WEEKLY or MONTHLY files.
	2.5  TREND_PHA_SPD.PRO		Used to create color intensity plot from STICS_PHA_TREND.FOR
					(1.10) data file.
	2.6  TREND_ION_PLT.PRO		Used to create color line plots from STICS_PHA_TREND.FOR
					(1.10) data file.
	2.7  STICS_IMAGE.PRO		Creates Mass vs Mass/Charge color intensity plot from data
					file generated by STICS_MQET_MATRIX.FOR (1.3)  
	2.8  STICS_DVS_SECT.PRO		Creates color intensity plot from data file generated by
					STICS_DVS_SECT.FOR (1.11)
                                        
	2.9  DVS_TIME_IMAGE.PRO		Creates color intensity plot from data file generated by
					STICS_DVS_TIME.FOR (1.12)
