Dear Bob,
while I was preparing a program to read and interpret the Level 0 CD-ROM
I found some facts which are not according to the
	Data Format Control Document (DFCD) between the
	International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) Program
	Information Processing Division (IPD)
	Ground Data Processing System
	and the
	ISTP Mission Investigators
	dated March 1993
Document: 560-1DFD/0190
	  CSC/TR-91/6014
1.	The SWICS / MASS / STICS  ( SMS ) experiment is sometimes called
	SMS and sometimes called SIC.  The CD-ROM contains the SMS data
	under the pseudonym SIC.  The File Label Record also contains
	the name 'SIC'.
2.	It is nice and correct to show the bitpattern of the PB5 time code,
	but it would be even nicer when it would be shown how its 56 bits
	are placed within two INTEGER*4 words.
3.	The descriptions of the EDIT files and keys just do not fit between
	the document and the File Label Record.  I gave up.
4.	The Telemetry Mode Indicator in the Data Record Header has the value 5.
	The document does not show a mode 5.
5.	The document and the data on the CD-ROM show more data for the house-
	keeping then is allocated to the SMS experiment.  SMS has been allocated
	byte 17 in minor frames 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101, 111,
	121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 201, 211, 221, 231, and 241.
	Byte 18 is allocated to SMS in minor frames 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 27, 33,
	37, 43, 47, 53, 57, 63, 67, 73, 77, 83, 87, 93, 97, 103, 107, 113, 117,
	123, 127, 133, 137, 143, 147, 153, 157, 163, 167, 183, 187, 193, 197,
	203, 207, 213, 217, 223, 227, 233, 237, 243, and 247.  This is a total
	of 75 bytes.  The allocation is the same for Science, Contingency, or
	Maneuver Mode.
These are the discrepancies I found, what I did not find in the Header data was
any indication of the Telemetry Rate.  Do you think it would be possible that
the Data Record Header could be expanded to include that information ?  There
is room, and since our data differs with the Telemetry Rate it certainly would
be a valuable enhancement.
