                              RUNNING WIND_CD_READ
________________________________________________________________________________
WHAT IS WIND_CD_READ?
WIND_CD_READ is the program that processes the Level Zero data files from
Goddard into Level 1 files.  Its source can be found on UMSMS on SMS1: in the
directory [WIND.SOFTWARE.LZ], and the most recent debugged copy of the
executable is in WIND_EXE:.
WHAT ARE WIND_CD_READ'S INPUTS AND OUTPUTS?
The input Level Zero data files are in a directory pointed to by the logical
name WIND_LZ_DATA:, which currently evaluates to SMSDISK2:[WIND.LZDATA].  The
output Level 1 data files are placed into the directory pointed to by the
logical name WIND_L1_DATA:, which is currently SMSDISK3:[WIND.L1DATA].  The
attitude and orbit CDF data files are in directories pointed to by the logical
names WIND_AT_DATA: and WIND_OR_DATA:, respectively.
WHAT ARE WIND_CD_READ'S OPTIONS?
Some of WIND_CD_READ's actions are governed by user-settable options, rather
than prompts.  This is done so the same procedure and set of prompts can be
used in several different ways.  The options currently available are setting
diagnostic level, NRT mode operation, PRINTLZ mode operation, batch mode
operation, filling the file header comment field, and requiring ephemeris data.
    Diagnostic Level
    The logical name WIND_DIAG is used to set the diagnostic level for
    WIND_CD_READ.  It should be set to an unsigned integer in the range 1-5.  A
    lower value will cause WIND_CD_READ to generate more diagnostic output.  A
    value of 5, which is the default value, produces the minimal amount of
    output.
    NRT Mode Operation
    WIND_CD_READ can also process NRT data files.  Since these files reside in
    a different directory on UMSMS and contain certain anomalies different code
    paths are used in certain sections of the program.  If the logical name
    WIND_NRT_MODE is defined WIND_CD_READ will change its behavior to operate
    correctly on NRT data.  The default action is to assume the input is a
    Level Zero (LZ) file.
    PRINTLZ Mode Operation
    WIND_CD_READ can also be used as a diagnostic tool to dump Level Zero
    files.  If operated in this mode WIND_CD_READ does not produce a Level 1
    file, but instead produces a (rather large) file containing ASCII dumps of
    each EDB and HDB.  The output file is named the same as the input LZ file
    but is given a file type of .DMP .  If WIND_CD_READ is renamed (or copied)
    to PRINTLZ.EXE and run under that name it assumes it is to operate in
    PRINTLZ mode.
    Batch Job Mode
    This flag is set automatically by WIND_CD_READ.  It detects if the program
    is being run interactively or as part of a batch job.  This information is
    used by  WIND_CD_READ in how it formats some of its messages.
    File Header Comment
    WIND_CD_READ allows the user to place an arbitrary comment string into the
    file header of the L1 being being generated.  This is done by using the
    logical name WIND_COMMENT.  If WIND_COMMENT is defined its translated value
    is stored in the file header and the comment length field is set
    accordingly; if it is not defined no comment is put in the header and the
    comment length field is set to zero. 
    Require Ephemeris Data
    WIND_CD_READ automatically checks for Ephemeris data (attitude and orbit
    data files).  If these files are present selected data from each are
    written to the record header of each L1 record.  If either of these files
    is missing WIND_CD_READ normally omits both the attitude and orbit data but
    processes the Level Zero file nonetheless.  If the logical name
    WIND_HALT_NO_EPH is defined WIND_CD_READ will stop if either of the
    attitude or orbit data files cannot be read.  This is useful if the user
    wants to ensure each generated L1 file contains attitude and orbit data.
HOW TO RUN WIND_CD_READ
Enter the command 
	$ RUN WIND_EXE:WIND_CD_READ
Most of the inputs to WIND_CD_READ program rely on default values (shown
between slashes, /thus/), so the user does not have to enter too many values.
When WIND_CD_READ is run, the following message is displayed:
                            +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
                            |                                 |
                            +          WIND_CD_READ           +
                            |                                 |

                            +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
        IS THIS THE VERSION YOU WANT ?/Yes/
The default is shown between the slashes, so simply hit return and you will 
be prompted for the input file name:
        LZ-FILENAME = 
        FILENAME = /DATA_DIR:WI*LZ*.DAT/ 
You may enter a specific filename (including directory spec) or simply press
return.  If you do the latter, a menu of all the files meeting the pattern
between the slashes will come up, as shown below:
          1  SMSDISK2:[WIND.LZDATA]WI_LZ_SMS_19941114_V02.DAT;1
          2  SMSDISK2:[WIND.LZDATA]WI_LZ_SMS_19941125_V02.DAT;1
          3  SMSDISK2:[WIND.LZDATA]WI_LZ_SMS_19941202_V02.DAT;1
Enter selection # (or q=quit, r=redisplay, <return>=show more): 
If there are too many files to fit on one page, then return will cause more to 
be displayed.  If you enter a number, the indicated file will be used, and the
program will ask you to confirm your choice:
        EXPLICIT FILENAME = SMSDISK2:[WIND.LZDATA]WI_LZ_SMS_19941114_V02.DAT;1
        IS THIS OKAY ?/Yes/ 
Simply hit return.  The program then begins to read the Level Zero data and
reports the file's record size.  At this point it also accesses the Ephemeris
data, if it is available.  If it is not available an additional message will be
displayed.
         Record_Size =  10800
        Ephemeris data unavailable.  The program will continue unless interrupted 
WIND_CD_READ now queries you about the Level 1 name.  The L1 file will have the
same name as the Level 0 file except "L1" will replace "LZ", as shown below. 
This can be overridden.  If you wish a different Level 1 file name, then enter
it at the prompt below.  Otherwise, just press return again.
        L1-FILENAME = SMSDISK3:[WIND.L1DATA]WI_L1_SMS_19941114_V02.DAT;1
        FILENAME = /SMSDISK3:[WIND.L1DATA]WI_L1_SMS_19941114_V02.DAT;1/ 
Next, WIND_CD_READ asks for confirmation of the L1 file name.  If a version
of the L1 file does not exist WIND_CD_READ will inform you of this.  Simply
hit return. 
        EXPLICIT FILENAME = SMSDISK2:[WIND.L1DATA]WI_L1_SMS_19941114_V02.DAT;1
        IS THIS OKAY ?/Yes/ 
If a version of the L1 file already exists WIND_CD_READ will report that it
is creating a new file.  The program then opens the L1 file.  If necessary
WIND_CD_READ will automatically swap the two parts of the spacecraft clock
and inform of its action. 
        NEW VERSION OF L1 FILE BEING CREATED  
        THIS_YEAR, SC_Year =        1995        2010
        SC clock parts will be swapped               
Next the program asks you what time reference that you prefer.  If you are 
going to process the whole file, the answer to this question is moot. 
Otherwise press return to get UT.
Do you prefer S/C clock ?/No/ 
Then you are prompted for a start time.  Specify a negative number for the
whole file.
         STARTING YEAR IS (NEG = ALL DATA ON FILE) /1993/ 
Input is now complete.  The program will process the data file.
