                                WIND_POSITION
    WIND_POSITION is a program to extract the WIND satellite's position and
display it in a form easily loaded into a spreadsheet.  Its major subroutines
and their calling sequences are listed below.
    The program prompts the user for what information is to be extracted and
dumped.  It then accesses the appropriate set of CDF files, concatenates the
data retrieved, transforms it as the user requested, and writes it to the
appropriate output device, being it terminal or file.
GET_ORBIT_REQUEST
    This routine obtains information from the user about what time interval
should be dumped, what coordinates should be dumped, and whether any
transformations should be performed prior to dumping.  While initially
implemented as an interactive prompt for the user this may be changed to some
other type of interface.
	MODE	   I	I*4	operating mode; ignored for now
	BEG_DATE   O	R*8	date/time of first position requested
	END_DATE   O	R*8	date/time of last position requested
	WHAT_INFO  O	L*4	array indicating what position information to
				display
	UNITS	   O	I*4	whether or not to translate into alternate
				units: 0 = no change (kM), 1 = Earth radii
	SYSTEM	   O	I*4	whether or not to transform into an alternate
				coordinate system: 0 = no change, 1 = spherical
				(r,theta,phi)
GET_EPHEMERIS
    This routine accesses a particular day's orbit and attitude CDF files and
returns all the data in each file in a common block.
	OR_NAME  I	CH*(*)	name of CDF file containing orbit data
	AT_NAME  I	CH*(*)	name of CDF file containing attitude data
	STATUS   O	I*4	returned status of CDF operations
GET_ORBIT_DAYS
    This routine returns all requested orbit information for a given time
frame, which is an interval between two dates. 
	BEG_DATE   I	R*8	date/time of first position requested
	END_DATE   I	R*8	date/time of last position requested
	WHAT_INFO  I	L*4	array indicating what position information to
				return
	MAXSIZE	   I	I*4	size of data array to hold result
	NSTORED	   O	I*4	number of array elements stored into
	GCI_POS    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GCI positions
	GCI_VEL    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GCI velocities
	GSE_POS    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GSE positions
	GSE_POS    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GSE velocities
	GSM_POS    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GSM positions
	GSM_POS    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of GSM velocities
	SUN_VEC    O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of sun vectors
CONVERT_ORBIT_INFO
    This routine is called if the position information needs to be transformed
to some other system of units, such as Re (Earth radii), or spherical
coordinates, or both.  The input coordinates are assumed to be in units of
kilometers in a Cartesian space (x,y,z). 
	I_POSITION I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of position coordinates
	UNITS	   I	I*4	whether or not to translate into alternate
				units: 0 = No change, 1 = Earth radii
	SYSTEM	   I	I*4	whether or not to transform into an alternate
				coordinate system: 0 = No change, 1 = Spherical
				(r,theta,phi)
	NSIZE	   I	I*4	size of input and output arrays (# of valid
				entries)
	O_POSITION O	/EPHEMERIS/	output array of position coordinates
	EARTH_DIST O	R*8	output array of distance from Earth, in the
				units requested by the UNITS parameter
DUMP_ORBIT_INFO
    This routine displays the requested coordination information in a form
easily usable by a spreadsheet program.  The display is prefaced by a heading
indicating the range of dates in the dump and the values being displayed.
	D_UNIT	   I	I*4	Fortran unit number to write the dump to;
				assumes is already open
	BEG_DATE   I	R*8	date/time of first position dumped
	END_DATE   I	R*8	date/time of last position dumped
	WHAT_POS   I	L*4	array indicating what position information to
				return
	UNITS	   I	I*4	whether or not to translate into alternate
				units: 0 = No change, 1 = Earth radii
	SYSTEM	   I	I*4	whether or not to transform into an alternate
				coordinate system: 0 = No change, 1 = Spherical
				(r,theta,phi)
	NSIZE	   I	I*4	size of input and output arrays (# of valid
				entries)
	GCI_POS    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GCI positions
	GCI_VEL    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GCI velocities
	GSE_POS    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GSE positions
	GSE_POS    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GSE velocities
	GSM_POS    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GSM positions
	GSM_POS    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of GSM velocities
	SUN_VEC    I	/EPHEMERIS/	input array of sun vectors
